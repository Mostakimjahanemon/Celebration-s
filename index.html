      You may not like my words.   Still read my boring words.   Trust me nica, I never ignored you.   You might have thought that I ignored you for my long absence.   Seeing the current generation and surroundings, my mother asked me to stop using the phone for a few days.   This is why I could not talk to you in May and November.   My mother used to do this before exams.    You misunderstood me.    Again, I did not ignore you, and I will never.  I don't know exactly whether my absence has hurt you or not.    I'm very sorry if this hurts you.    I will never intentionally ignore you.    Maybe the less you feel for me the better.   But I'm always there for you.    If I can't message you for a long time, don't think I'm ignoring you.    Maybe I won't be able to use the phone from tomorrow.    Don't forget me nica.    I will always remember you.    I will be back soon.    I say these things so that you do not suffer.    I'll be happy if you don't suffer.   Today you told me that when you talk to me, you will teach me Filipino.    I would also be very happy to learn this from you.    Thanks for your effort and desire.    Maybe it would have been better if you started it earlier.   I was free for the whole of December, but you didn't talk to me because of the misunderstanding.    Belief is the key to all types of relationships. I hope you believe me and do.    Don't be upset for me, the reason for saying it is There is 30% chance (not 100%) that you will be upset for me.    Anyway, I have said all the bad things so far, maybe I shouldn't have said them on your birthday today.    I still said because maybe I won't be able to come online tomorrow.   I always praying for you, you are one of my favorite persons.    My family, teachers expect something  good from me, so pray for me.    You also move on in life.    Celebrate your life, especially today.    Today is a special day in two ways.    It's your birthday, and today is the first day of the new year.    Try to be happy.  What else can I say, I can't give much advice haha.    At last, promise me that you won't feel sad/upset for me.    If you tell me, I will be very happy indeed."

    <h3>June 14, 2025 – Revisited</h3>
    <div class="long-message" onclick="toggleMessageWithBurst(this)">
      'HAPPY 2nd ANNIVERSARY, Nica.
Two years have passed. Our friendship is strong now, and we both want it to be even stronger in the future. These two years brought a lot—good, bad, happy, sad memories. But now, everything is okay. From beginning to now, A to Z — all of it is okay.

I mentioned our 7th anniversary before, saying I want to see us still together then. I believe that if two people can stay friends for 7 years, no one can break that bond easily. There will be no doubt about our friendship. Only 5 years left — we got this. All we need is trust and understanding.

It doesn’t matter how long we don’t talk — I always remember you and love you from my place.
Our happiness depends on our mindset and thoughts, so we should always think positively. Never compare our friendship with others’. I’m unique too. Maybe I can't give you what you expect — but if you don’t tell me what that is, I might never know. And that can affect our friendship in a bad way — and neither of us wants that.

Never make a decision based on what others say. Don’t listen to third parties — talk to me. We can fix anything. Only my sister, my friend Rexa, and my C. Master know about you. I never talk about you publicly because I don’t want to give anyone the chance to say something bad about you. I love you very much, and I can’t accept anything negative about you.

Two days ago, you had some negative thoughts — like what if I leave you (which is impossible) without any reason. I know it would hurt you — but remember, I loved you first. My feelings are deep. If something like that ever happened, it would hurt me even more. That’s why I won’t do it.

You’ve never seen me, never even talked to me — so I know trusting me isn’t easy. But you still trusted me, and I don’t even have words for how grateful I am.

Finally, I just want one thing from you now — to see you strong.

> You’re stronger than you think, Nica. Even when life feels heavy, I know there’s a warrior inside you who never gives up.
Every challenge you face is just another proof that you’re built to rise, not break.
I may not be there physically, but my support, prayers, and love are always around you. You’re never alone in this fight.
You don’t need to be perfect — just real, just brave, just you. That’s already more than enough.
It’s okay to fall, but promise me you’ll always stand back up. Your comeback will always be stronger than the setback.
Whatever storms you face, I believe in your ability to survive and shine through them. Your strength is your superpower.
The world may not always be kind, but I want you to never doubt your worth. You’re valuable, powerful, and deserving of every good thing.
And when you're feeling weak, I hope you remember these words: You are not fragile. You are fire. 🔥



And remember…

> No matter where you are or what you're going through, just know I’m always here for you — silently cheering, praying, and believing in you.
Even when life feels unfair or lonely, remember you have someone who truly cares for you — me.
If you ever feel lost, confused, or tired — don’t hesitate to lean on me. I may not have all the answers, but I’ll always be your safe space.
You don’t have to face everything alone. I may be far, but I promise my heart is always near.
Your pain is not a burden to me. Your silence is not invisible to me. I see you, I feel you, and I’m with you — always.
In your weakest moments, I’ll remind you of your strength. In your darkest hours, I’ll be your light.
I may not be perfect, but I’ll always try to be the person who never lets you face the storm alone.
If the world turns its back on you, I won’t. I’ll stand with you — even if it’s just in words, even if it’s just in spirit.
You’ve always got me in your corner. Quietly, endlessly, loyally supporting you.' 🌟

    <h3>Friendship Day</h3>
    <div class="long-message" onclick="toggleMessageWithBurst(this)">
      'To You, Who Stayed
(It's been 2 years of friendship.)

I never thought someone like you would come into my life—
someone who understands even the words I don’t say,
someone who can make me laugh even when I’m silently breaking.

Thank you.
For all the small things you’ve done that meant everything to me.
For the “Have you eaten?” and “You got this,”
that may sound simple—but they made me feel truly cared for.

Two years now, right?
We’ve shared so much—
secrets, stories, and promises we never had to say out loud…
because we already knew.

I hope no matter what happens,
you’ll still be around in the years to come.
Even if we don’t talk every day,
may we never forget that we have something real:
a friendship that never asked for anything in return,
but gave everything anyway.

🤍 Happy Friendship Day.
Thank you for the two years—and hopefully, for more to come. – Your bestfriend BON'

January 1 is not just the start of a new year.<br>
It’s the day the world became brighter—because you were born.<br>
While everyone celebrates a new beginning, I celebrate you.<br>
A new year begins with hope, and your birthday reminds me that hope has a name: Nica.

<div class="birthday-box" onclick="burstHearts(this)">
💫 Why This Day Is Special<br>
This day matters to me because you exist.<br>
Because someone with a kind heart, soft care, and quiet strength came into this world.<br>
Your birthday isn’t just about candles or wishes—it’s about appreciating the soul that makes life warmer for others.

🎈 A Birthday Wish From My Heart<br>
On your birthday, I wish you:<br>
Peace on days when life feels heavy 🌙<br>
Strength when you feel tired or unsure 💪<br>
Smiles that come naturally, not forced 😊<br>
Success in studies and dreams you haven’t even spoken yet 📚<br>
And happiness that stays, even in silence 💖<br>
May every year make you stronger, wiser, and closer to everything you dream of.

This birthday, I want you to remember: You are valued.<br>
You are important.<br>
You are deeply cared for.

my care does not reduce.<br>
Distance does not erase bonds built with sincerity.

🕊️ A Quiet Truth<br>
From this birthday onward, I may not always be present online.<br>
Studies, responsibilities, and Class 10 will demand my time.<br>

Absence is not abandonment.<br>
Even in silence, I am rooting for you.<br>
Even without messages, I am thinking of you.

<div class="birthday-box" onclick="burstHearts(this)">
🎁 This Page Is My Gift<br>
This website, these words, this effort—<br>

Something you can open anytime.<br>
Something that reminds you you’re never alone.

🌌 For the Future You<br>
No matter where life takes us—<br>

is silently proud of you.<br>
Keep growing.<br>
Keep dreaming.<br>
Keep being you.

Today is not just a day to celebrate your birth, but also a moment to celebrate you, your life, and the beautiful soul that you are. I’ve been thinking about what I want to tell you for a long time, and I want these words to carry all my feelings—love, care, memories, and promises—all the things that sometimes I cannot say in person but feel deeply in my heart.<br><br>It’s hard to believe that from June 14, 2023, the day I first messaged you on Messenger, our journey began. That day changed my life completely, and little did I know that it would bring me someone as amazing as you. Two years have passed since then, and every moment, every laugh, every memory with you has become a treasure that I hold close. From the first “Hi” we exchanged to every conversation we’ve had, you have been a light in my life—even in moments when life felt heavy.<br><br>I remember long ago when you told me that you liked me as a friend. At that time, my heart was full, but I respected what you said because I wanted our friendship to grow strong and safe. Later, when I told you “I love you” on November 7, 2023, my feelings were deep, honest, and vulnerable. I know things were complicated, and you loved someone else, but even through that, I never stopped caring for you. My heart stayed with you, quietly, patiently, hoping that we would understand each other better with time. 💫<br><br>There were times when our friendship faced challenges. I remember the moments when I could not talk to you for long periods, when you might have felt I was ignoring you. It was never my intention. Sometimes, my mother asked me to stay away from the phone for exams or family matters, and I couldn’t explain it to you immediately. I understand now that it may have hurt you or made you feel distant from me. I was sad too, Nica. Those days when I waited to see your messages, or when I saw you online but couldn’t talk, were difficult for me. I often worried that I had lost you or that the warmth between us might fade. But even in silence, my heart never left you. 💔<br><br>I remember how it felt when I saw your old messages, when I realized how much you had cared for me, even when things were hard. It made me cry, not because of anger or pain, but because I realized how precious our bond is. Every smile, every joke, every “good morning” and “good night” we shared built this strong connection that I treasure more than anything in this world. You taught me patience, understanding, and the true meaning of friendship. And even when I was hurt, I never stopped loving you—not romantically in a way to force you, but with a deep, pure care that wishes for your happiness above everything. 🌹<br><br>Our friendship has grown through so many moments—both happy and sad. I will never forget the time when you blocked me or when I thought I might have lost you forever. That was one of the worst days of my life. I couldn’t think properly, couldn’t focus on my studies, and my mood changed completely. But then, when you unblocked me and we started talking again, my heart felt light, and I realized that our bond is stronger than any misunderstanding. Those moments of sadness, confusion, and fear taught me the value of trust, patience, and forgiveness in our friendship. They showed me that even when things go wrong, our connection can survive if we care for each other sincerely.<br><br>I want to remind you, Nica, that even when life feels heavy, even when we are apart, and even when I cannot talk to you for days, my thoughts are always with you. I will never intentionally ignore you. If I cannot message you, it is never because I do not care; it is because life, responsibilities, or studies demand my attention. Even if the world misunderstands us, I hope you never doubt my heart. My care, my thoughts, and my love are always around you—even in silence. 💌<br><br>You’ve brought so much light into my life. You’ve taught me how to appreciate small moments, how to laugh even when things are hard, and how to be patient with the people we care about. You’ve been my inspiration, my comfort, and my joy. I know that sometimes life can be tiring, and I want to remind you that it’s okay to feel tired or sad. Those moments do not make you weak—they make you human, and they remind me how strong and brave you truly are. 🌟<br><br>I want to tell you something important, Nica. From January 1, 2026, I may not be able to use my phone as much because I will be busy with my studies in Class 10. It makes me sad to think that I cannot talk to you durwish this time, but I want you to know that my absence does not mean my care is gone. Even if I can’t reply or chat, I am always thinking of you, praying for you, and wishing for your happiness. This year, more than ever, I hope you take care of yourself, stay strong, and remember that I am silently supporting you from afar. 🕊️<br><br>Nica, you are not just my friend—you are my best friend, my confidant, and a beautiful soul I am endlessly grateful for. I love how you care, how you laugh, how you share your feelings, and even how you have the courage to face life’s challenges. You are one of the strongest people I know, and I hope that whenever life feels unfair or difficult, you remember that strength lives inside you. You have survived hard days before, and you will continue to rise again and again. I believe in you completely. 💖<br><br>We have shared secrets, laughter, games, and moments that only we understand. I want to honor all of that in this letter, because those moments are the foundation of what makes us “Emonica”—a bond so unique that no one can break it. We promised each other long ago that we will trust, wait, and stay loyal to each other no matter what. Even when life keeps us apart or when misunderstandings happen, I want you to remember that my heart will always stay with you. The bond we have is rare, Nica. It is strong, loving, and infinite. 🌌<br><brAs I continue writing to you, I must remember the moments when life felt heavy for both of us. I know there were times when you were tired, overwhelmed, or even hurt by situations, and I wish more than anything that I could have been there physically to hold your hand, to reassure you, to let you know that everything will be okay. I remember the days when I saw your messages slowed down, when your words carried a little sadness, or when life seemed unfair to you. I felt those moments deep in my heart. It hurt me to know that sometimes you felt alone, even when I was silently praying for your happiness.<br><br>I remember the first time I truly felt the weight of losing you, or the fear of it. That day in November, when you blocked me, I couldn’t think or focus. I cried, Nica. I couldn’t sleep properly. I couldn’t study. I felt empty, as if a part of my heart was missing. That pain reminded me how important you are to me, not just as a friend, but as someone who makes life brighter and fuller. Those moments, though sad, taught me the true meaning of caring for someone deeply. 🌙<br><br>There were also moments when I misunderstood you, or you might have misunderstood me. I know I may have seemed distant or absent at times, and I never wanted that to make you feel unloved or unimportant. I know your heart might have felt heavy with thoughts like, “Has Emon forgotten me?” or “Does he still care?” And the truth is, Nica, even when I couldn’t send a message, even when I had to step away for my studies or family duties, I was always thinking of you. Your happiness and peace were always in my heart, quietly, silently, like a candle that never goes out. 🕯️<br><br>Do you remember the playful moments we shared? The little games we played, the guessing games where I tried to amaze you? Like the time I guessed your bird “Eagle” correctly—you were so amazed, and your laughter made my heart soar. Those moments remind me that friendship is not just about words; it’s about understanding each other, sharing joy, and making memories that light up our days. Even when things were difficult, those small, playful moments were sparks of happiness that connected us. 🌟<br><br>And yet, there were moments when I hurt. When I saw your messages from the past, I realized how much pain I might have caused by misunderstandings or absence. I cried many times, Nica, not in anger but in longing—for us to truly understand each other, for our bond to be unshakable. There were nights when I thought, “What if I lost her forever?” But each time, something inside me whispered, “She will come back. She will understand. She trusts you.” And I held onto that hope, because I believed in us, in the strength of our friendship. 💞<br><br>I also remember how we shared secrets, simple things that only we understood. Your birthday being January 1, my birthday being June 1—our months start with ‘J’—a little coincidence, but to me, it’s magical. Those small details, like our shared inside jokes, the way we could laugh at nothing, and the promises we made to each other, are treasures I will always hold. They remind me that our friendship is rare, unique, and full of meaning. ✨<br><br>There were sad moments too—like when your grandfather passed away. I know it’s been hard for you, Nica, and my heart aches knowing you are in pain. I wish I could be there to comfort you, to ease your sorrow, to let you feel the warmth of care that I always carry for you. Life can be unfair sometimes, and I hate that you had to feel that sadness. But I hope you know this: even when I am far away, I am silently supporting you, praying for you, wishing for your smile. Your strength, even in grief, inspires me endlessly. 🌹<br><br>Nica, we have faced so many ups and downs together. We have shared joy, laughter, tears, and misunderstandings. And yet, through everything, our trust has remained. We promised each other that no matter how long we don’t talk, no matter how difficult life gets, we will wait for each other and trust each other. That promise is sacred to me, Nica. Even if I cannot be online after your birthday because of Class 10 studies, I will always be with you in thought and spirit. That promise, and our trust, is a bridge that keeps us close even when life pulls us apart. 🌉<br><br>I also remember your kind and caring heart—the way you think of others, the way you comfort me, even in small gestures, the way you are patient, gentle, and understanding. Those qualities make you extraordinary, Nica. You care deeply, and it shows in everything you do. You have inspired me to be better, to love sincerely, and to treasure people in my life. I want you to know that your caring nature never goes unnoticed. I see it, I feel it, and I am grateful for it every single day. 💖<br><br>Through the sad moments and the joyful moments, the playful games and serious talks, the misunderstandings and clarifications, one thing has never changed: my devotion to you as my friend, my admiration for you as a person, and my hope for our future together as “Emonica.” That bond we share, Nica, is unbreakable because it is built on trust, love, care, patience, and understanding. 🌌<br><br>And even when life demands I focus on my studies or responsibilities, I want you to remember: nothing can reduce the care I have for you. Not distance, not time, not misunderstandings. Every memory, every secret, every smile you’ve given me lives in my heart, and I carry it with me, always. That’s what friendship means to me—it’s more than words. It’s about presence, even in absence. It’s about loyalty, even when life is busy. It’s about trust, hope, and love, even when life is hard. As your special day approaches, I want to pause and celebrate you, the amazing person who has made my life brighter, richer, and filled with meaning. Your birthday, January 1, is not just the start of a new year—it’s a reminder of the wonderful light you bring to everyone around you, including me. This year, 2026, marks another milestone in your life, and I wish(wish) I could be there beside you to laugh, to cheer, and to celebrate the incredible person you are. 🥳🎂<br><b>I know life hasn’t always been easy, Nica. You’ve faced challenges, sadness, and times when your heart felt heavy. But even in the hardest moments, you’ve shown a strength that inspires me endlessly. You have a courage inside you that I hope you never forget—a warrior who faces life’s storms with quiet determination and a heart that cares deeply for others. Even when things feel overwhelming, remember that you are never alone, because I am always here, cheering for you, praying for you, believing in you. 🌹<br><br>This year, as you celebrate your birthday, I want to remind you of our promise—that we will never leave each other, no matter how long we may not talk. That even if life takes us through challenges, studies, or distance, our trust and friendship remain unshakable. Remember, Nica: our friendship is rare, Emonica is real, and it is built on trust, patience, understanding, and care. These promises we made are stronger than any obstacle life may place in our path. 💎<br><br>I want you to embrace this year with hope, courage, and positivity. Study hard, dream big, and always remember to take care of yourself. Eat properly, sleep well, and hydrate—because your body and mind are treasures that allow you to shine brightly in this world. Even as I become busy with Class 10 studies, know that my thoughts and prayers are always with you. I am cheering for your success, your happiness, and your growth every single day. 📚✨<br><br>Nica, I hope you can carry with you these words of encouragement:<br><br>> You are stronger than you think.<brEven when life feels heavy, remember the warrior inside you who never gives up.<brEvery challenge you face is a chance to grow, to shine, and to rise.<br>You don’t need to be perfect—just be yourself, brave, kind, and real.<br>The world may not always understand your worth, but I do, and I always will.<br>You are valuable, powerful, and capable of achieving every dream in your heart. 💖<br><br><br>Your kindness, your warmth, your laughter—they are gifts that make life brighter. Never doubt your value or underestimate the impact you have on those who care about you. The way you listen, care, and encourage others, even when you yourself are tired, shows the depth of your heart. You inspire me to be better, to love sincerely, and to cherish the people who matter most. 🌸<br><br>I also want to celebrate the playful, joyful moments we’ve shared—like our little guessing games, our inside jokes, and the laughter that could fill any distance between us. Those moments are proof that even in sadness or confusion, joy can be found when we are together in spirit. Your happiness, Nica, is one of my greatest treasures, and I will do my best to keep it alive with words, memories, and care, even when I cannot be physically present. 🌟<br><br>This birthday, I wish you:<br>Endless joy and laughter, even in quiet moments. 😄<br>Strength to face challenges without fear. 💪<br>Patience for yourself and others, even when life feels unfair. ⏳<br>Love from those around you, including my silent support and prayers. 💌<br>A heart full of hope, inspiration, and motivation to reach every dream you have. 🌈<br><br>Though I may not be able to message you starting January 1, 2026, due to my Class 10 studies, please never forget: I am always with you in spirit. My heart will always be near yours, cheering for you, silently supporting you, believing in you. You are never alone, Nica, because our bond is unbreakable. 🌌<br><br>Finally, I want to say this, my dearest Nica: thank you. Thank you for being you. Thank you for trusting me, loving me as a friend, and allowing me to be a part of your life. Thank you for the laughter, the care, the memories, and even the tears, because every single one of them has made our friendship stronger, deeper, and more meaningful. 🤍<br><br>Happy birthday, Nica. May this year be as beautiful, inspiring, and extraordinary as you are. Celebrate yourself, embrace your dreams, and never forget your worth. And remember, no matter where life takes us, I am always here—loyal, caring, and endlessly cheering for you. 💙<br><br>With all my heart,<br>Emon";
